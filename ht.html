        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
